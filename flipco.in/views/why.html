<p>I went hiking with four friends. Everybody lives in a different city. Two
  wanted to go to Germany, two to Belgium. Finding nothing useful I decided it
  was time to create something myself. Besides coin flips are cool.</p>

<p>Why this is so dog ugly? I can't design or do HTML/CSS. So sue me. Better
  yet help me out!</p>

<p>Why the blink tag??! It's a coin flip site. I thought it appropriate.</p>
